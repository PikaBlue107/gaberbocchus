Fresh off the boat, aye? Welcome to Eventyr.

What?

One of these days, I’m gonna tell the kids I’m going fishing and catch myself something real big.

I want you to meet my brother Adel.

You seem like a hardy kid. At least you’re tall. Fancy a pitchfork, boy? 

LUCIA
(Say no, say no, say no—)

JIMSON
Did you know there are eleven kinds of pitchforks? I got ‘em all! One would go real well with that hat of yours.

ADEL
Sure, I’ll take a pitchfork.
No thanks. 

LUCIA
No. You’re already armed. I don’t need you in possession of any more sharp objects. Thanks Jimson, but we’ll be leaving now. 
Oh no, how sad, so sorry Jimson, maybe next time.

Worth a try.
