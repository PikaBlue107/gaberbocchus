STORY SCENES
Necessary, required for progress.

STORY SCENE 1: Dock Intro

[Adel is either on dock, or can walk from boat to dock.]

LUCIA
Hey! Heeeey! Adel!

[Lucia comes running up to Adel → joins, begins following]

LUCIA
Welcome to Eventyr! Glad you’re alive. And I’m only saying this once, so listen up: Thank you so much for coming out here for me. 

ADEL
No problem. 
Sorry, couldn’t hear you, wanna say that again? 

LUCIA
Yes problem, actually, we have so many problems. 
Nope! I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ADEL
What do you need me for? Your letters are always so vague. 

LUCIA
I have a right as your sister to be as vague as I please, but I’ll tell you later—once we’re not out in the open. Get yourself situated around town first, and we can head to the apothecary once you’re done. I’ll explain everything there. 

ADEL
Is that really necessary?

LUCIA
Yes. 

(End)



STORY SCENE 2: Apothexposition

[Adel and Lucia enter the apothecary.]

LUCIA
Welcome to my humble shop. Also known as the only reason anyone in this town is still alive. 

ADEL
Wow, that’s a lot of books.
…You deal with a lot of injuries here?

LUCIA
Obviously I’ve got a lot of books, Adel, you don’t learn decades-worth of medical knowledge through trial and error. 
Yeah, Pansy has a tendency to get into knife accidents. Ironically, pansies are really only useful for skin and lung diseases. I use marigolds for her.

ADEL
…Okay. Anyway. You said something about explaining? 

LUCIA
Right. 

LUCIA
We’re under siege. Or we’re about to be, anyway. 

LUCIA
There are… creatures in the forest. Dangerous ones. They used to stay in the deep woods, but they’ve become restless as of late… destroying crops, attacking townsfolk. One of them almost killed Sister Margaret. Couldn’t move her arm for weeks… I did what I could, of course. 

LUCIA
But we’re just not safe. 

ADEL
What do you need me for? I can protect you just fine, but I can’t be everywhere at once.

LUCIA
I think I know how to stop it. But I can’t do it myself. I can’t fight those things. And… and I love this town, but the people here just don’t have your skill. 

LUCIA
Most of the town avoids heading out to the woods, but I need to gather my herbs. There’s only so much you can garden. So I’m familiar with the area, to say the least. There are ruins everywhere in the deep woods—some kind of destroyed city. It’s been abandoned for a long time. 

LUCIA
But the monsters are coming from there, I’m certain of it. And if we can find the source…

ADEL
We can end it. 

LUCIA
Exactly. Are you in? 

ADEL
Got nothing better to do. 
You sure about this? I’m only in if you’re sure.

LUCIA
Alright. Tomorrow, then. Tonight, just… get some sleep. Head upstairs.
As sure as I’ve ever been. Head upstairs, get some sleep.

(End)


STORY SCENE 3: Spirit Dream Sequence

[Black?]

???
Adel. 

???
Hello, Adel. 

[Dream world appears?]

SPIRIT
Isn’t it lovely?

[Pause.]

SPIRIT
I have a proposal for you, Adel.

SPIRIT
You see… I’m afraid that Eventyr’s great peril is my fault. 

SPIRIT
Once, I was something more than this… I was a powerful spirit. A ruler, over a great stone city, with the forest as my domain. 

SPIRIT
But my subjects wanted more. I was attacked. Nearly murdered. Nearly killed, for nothing more than a bloodied dream of conquest. 

SPIRIT
I am forced to remain like this… small and forgotten. I have even forgotten my home. But you could help me, Adel, and in doing so, help Eventyr. Help your sister and her beloved town. Be the hero they’re so desperate for. 

SPIRIT
I will give you power. Power and guidance. Abilities beyond anything you’ve ever seen… and the wisdom of a once-great spirit, for whatever that is worth to you.

SPIRIT
All I ask in return is that you take me home. 

SPIRIT
If I can reclaim my home, my former subjects… my former people… they will not be a danger to you anymore. I’m certain of it. 

SPIRIT
Please, Adel. 

SPIRIT
Everyone needs you. 

[Pop-up choice]

ACCEPT THE OFFER? 
Yes
No

SPIRIT
Thank you.
Very well.
