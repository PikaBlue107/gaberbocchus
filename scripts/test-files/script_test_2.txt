STORY SCENE 1: Dock Intro

[Adel is either on dock, or can walk from boat to dock.]

LUCIA
Hey! Heeeey! Adel!

[Lucia comes running up to Adel → joins, begins following]

LUCIA
Welcome to Eventyr! Glad you’re alive. And I’m only saying this once, so listen up: Thank you so much for coming out here for me. 

ADEL
No problem. 
Sorry, couldn’t hear you, wanna say that again? 

LUCIA
Yes problem, actually, we have so many problems. 
Nope! I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ADEL
What do you need me for? Your letters are always so vague. 

LUCIA
I have a right as your sister to be as vague as I please, but I’ll tell you later—once we’re not out in the open. Get yourself situated around town first, and we can head to the apothecary once you’re done. I’ll explain everything there. 

ADEL
Is that really necessary?

LUCIA
Yes.
