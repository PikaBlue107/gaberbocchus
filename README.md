# csc281-visualgame-gaberbocchus
Gaberbocchus, the Visual Game Project for team "Blue Cat" in CSC 281 - Foundations of Interactive Game Design

Built using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

## Team Collaboration

For "Blue Cat" team members - to add new files to the project,
put them in the [src_assets](https://github.ncsu.edu/jvgriese/csc281-visualgame-gaberbocchus/tree/main/src_assets) folder.
From there, I'll copy/move them into the correct spot within the Godot project.

## Permitted Use of Assets

This project is built on top of a tutorial project, including code and resources.

The tutorial project is freely available under the MIT License,
