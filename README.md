# csc281-visualgame-gaberbocchus
Gaberbocchus, the Visual Game Project for team "Blue Cat" in CSC 281 - Foundations of Interactive Game Design

Built using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

## Project Structure

 - project: Editable Godot 3.4 project ("source code")

 - src_assets: Folder of hopefully all image and dialogue assets used ingame

 - exports: Exported, runnable versions of the game. Currently just Windows version

 - scripts: contains a single Python script (`translate_dialogue.py`),
 a script for translating dialogue copied from Google Docs into the `json` format expected by the game.



## Team Collaboration

For "Blue Cat" team members - to add new files to the project,
put them in the [src_assets](https://github.ncsu.edu/jvgriese/csc281-visualgame-gaberbocchus/tree/main/src_assets) folder.
From there, I'll copy/move them into the correct spot within the Godot project.
